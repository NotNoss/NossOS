# NossOS
NossOS is just a distro I made for a couple reasons listed below.

- I can stop repeating so many steps to setup my config
- I can learn more about distros, arch and linux
- Because I can

NOTE: Feel free to use NossOS or modify it how you would like. You can submit issues but this isn't intended on being a distro for the masses to use so whether or not I work on your issue is at my discression.

I will likely update it with configs for different desktop environments/window managers when I have time.
